>Perhaps most importantly, ‘zines can be weaponised against an increasingly neoliberal, commodified academy and help in returning focus to a relationship based on knowledge exchange between student and teacher (Bagelman and Bagelman 2016). - [Fitzpatrick, No Margins, No Word Counts, No Masters! Experimenting With 'Zines for Archaeological Outreach](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/fitzpatrick-zines.pdf)

I found it a little contradictory, or perhaps just a bit naive, how in this article Fitzpatrick first recognizes zines for their underground history in radical politics and outsider art, and then makes the call for academics to adopt this format for its emancipatory potential. But there is nothing about the format of the zine which brings about anything radical or subversive. The relationship between the two is precisely the opposite: it is because the people who were making these zines did not have access to major publishing institutions that they had to adopt a DIY format to get their ideas out. Anything especially radical or creative that came out of the cultures around zines did not come from the zines but rather the people in those communities. The common thread between all these communities which used zines (and the very reason why they adopted the format) was that they were coming from outside the establishment - does Fitzpatrick not realize that the academy is itself the ideological wing of the establishment? And does she not realize the irony in asserting that "‘zines can be weaponised against an increasingly neoliberal, commodified academy" when she is calling for the all-too-typically-neoliberal appropriation of zines into the academy?

discuss some ways in which a creative mindset might change what archaeology (or history for that matter) could be for you as a scholar. 

>Gonzáles-Ruibal et al. (2018: 507), in a vexed argument about current public archaeology, profess that the overt ideological models recently adopted by archaeologists ‘have promoted an agenda during the last decades that has left us politically and theoretically disempowered.’ By their logic, naïve efforts at inclusion and, by extension, affect have fostered populism, in the sense that everyone has a voice and a right to exercise that voice regardless of the coherence or veracity of the statements being made and their potential impacts on others. What results from such circumstances is a kind of ‘progressive neoliberalism’, ultimately leading to the opposite of social justice and ‘emancipatory politics’ (Gonzáles-Ruibal et al.,2018: 509). - [Perry, The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/Perry2019_Enchantment_AcceptedMS.pdf)

>Bennett offers various reflections on the generation of enchantment: it can be encountered by surprise or be deliberately generated (including through technological intervention) by play, art, laughter, attentiveness to specificities, as well as by resisting the idea that there is no such thing as enchantment. It is ‘an uneasy combination of artifice and spontaneity’ (Bennett, 2001: 10). It does not privilege happiness or positive affect, and it does not depend on divine intervention or fate or the necessity of a designed universe, because to do so enables ‘complacency in the face of cruelty and violence’ (Bennett, 2001: 10 after Voltaire). - [Perry, The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/Perry2019_Enchantment_AcceptedMS.pdf)

>Of importance, digital media play a tricky role in this sabotaging of outcomes, as they are often enrolled in wonderment programmes that seek to nurture the most stereotyped of affective impacts. This is perhaps no more obvious than with virtual reality (VR), the so-called ‘ultimate empathy machine,’ which is regularly professed to allow a first-hand experience of others’ lives merely via donning a head-mounted device. Loh (2017) offers a rich critique of the fallacy at play here,wherein we confuse the simple act of putting ourselves inside the representational frame with genuine understanding of others’ experiences. ‘True empathy’ requires work;it is ‘the labor of comprehension: mind-work, not gut-work alone’(Loh, 2017). - [Perry, The Enchantment of the Archaeological Record](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/Perry2019_Enchantment_AcceptedMS.pdf)


>They describe their aim in and the process of “refleshing” the remains (the  illustrations  were  created  by  John  Swogger)  as  you  see  them  in  these  charts  (Hager  and  Boz,  2012:300;  also  see  Hawkes  and  Molleson  2000):  “The  images  (reconstructions) represent the principal characters in the story of Building 3, and seeing them as people rather than as skeletons gives us a sense of who they might have been, young or old, male or female. The reconstructions help us see the people who in death, and perhaps in life, were directly linked to Building 3” (Hager and Boz 2012:300). - [Tringham, Closely Observed Layers: Storytelling and the Heart](https://digiarch.netlify.app/data/tringham-heart.pdf)
