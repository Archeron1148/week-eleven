Nothing Beside Remains
https://cutgarnetgames.itch.io/nothing-beside-remains

    Nothing Beside Remains is a very neat little game. Begining the game, I initially bumped into the fallen statue and recognized it as a reference to Ozymandias. But unlike that poem, which paints the image of the remains of a statue standing out alone in a vast dune of sand, this statue exists amoungst the ruins of a seemingly once very lived town. Beside where the statue once stood is what appears to be a temple, seemingly a place of directed, communal worship with ceramic jugs on a stone altar in the north end of the building and pews all along to the southern entrance. Connected behind the altar is a small room with marked ceramic and broken metal remains alongside wooden tables and chairs. It would seem this room was used for liturgical preperation if not for the number of chairs and the fact that the same objects there are found within the crumbling remains of other buildings found across the dusty stone pathways of the town. Perhaps this suggests that the temple also doubled as the living space for the local priest. What's most remarkable is the wetness still retained in the soil around this deserted town; If not for lack of adequate farmland, why did the original inhabitants leave? Take a peek into any old house and the answer will be clear as day: in nearly every one we see chairs which have claw or teeth marks on the legs, or with entire legs having been removed. I think the most rational explaination for 'why did they leave?' is that they were driven out after being terrorized by some yet unknown wild creature with a hunger for chair legs!

    I can't say for sure what literary tropes are present here but my assumption that the pews and the altar indicate 'a place of directed, communal worship' is certainly based on the cultural trope of Christian churches. I think that Indiana Jones and Nothing Beside Remains both reinforce a very pervasive stereotype of archaeological work - that is most commonly takes place in the sandy desert ruins of a lost civilization - which I think we ought to try to move people away from here in Canada because this view of archaeology excludes the sort of work archaeologists do with First Nations' communities: I think many get the idea that because there were no castles or statues or pyramids or booby-trapped tombs in Canada before the arrival of settles, theres not much archaeological work to do here.
